# Social Networking
My own take at a stupid social networking plattform for a school project.
I do not plan to become the next Meta or anything, yea

Also get ready for some shitty code in here, prepare mentally!

## Requirements
1. Node.js 0.10 or higher

## Getting started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/j10a1n15/social-networking.git
cd social-networking
npm install
npm start
```
